- Rework one or more demos to run with disaggregated task01.
  - startup scripts
  - config files

- Are there tasks/services that require dependent instantiation?

- The 'DO NOT REMOVE - ...' lines in src/Services/00_ServiceList.h are
  self-referential; the following line was most recently added by
  src/Services/00_NewService.py or src/Tasks/00_NewTask.py. Thus *all*
  files referenced are candidates (subject to yet-undiscovered dependencies)
  for disaggregation.

- Plan a new directory layout and builder to support disaggregation of
  all targeted tasks and services.
