- Rework one or more demos to run with disaggregated task01.
  - startup scripts
  - config files

- Are there tasks/services that require dependent instantiation?

- The 'DO NOT REMOVE - ...' lines in src/Services/00_ServiceList.h are
  self-referential; the following line was most recently added by
  src/Services/00_NewService.py or src/Tasks/00_NewTask.py. Thus *all*
  files referenced are candidates (subject to yet-undiscovered dependencies)
  for disaggregation.

- Plan a new directory layout and builder to support disaggregation of
  all targeted tasks and services. (This list is tentative, pending a
  better understanding of OpenUxAS architecture. See above.)

From meeting Jan 18th:

Create UxAS base and external service(s).
  - Each must have its own 00_ServiceList.h.
  - What *is* the common base?

Look at lmcpgen; it can regenerate an LMCP stack w/ proper dependencies - no
need to do this by hand.

There's a Python2 Amase that speaks LMCP directly.

Stretch goal for March: WaterwaySearch or DistributedCooperation in multiple
processes.

Two cycles left (Feb, Mar).

- How do I identify assets created/referenced by LmcpGen?
  - I need to be able to subset these.
  - See RunLmcpGen.sh.
  > New tools created: extract-lmcp-deps and extract-all-lmcp-deps
    - What can be inferred about tasks/services without LCMP dependency?
    - Attempt to generate build assets (directory structure, meson.build)
      for disaggregated tasks/services.
      - Try to build a "base UxAS" (*no* services) first.
  - âˆƒ 131 LMCP .cpp files included in the LMCP build, but not referenced
    by any header included by a Service or Task *header file* in UxAS.
    Let's leave this alone for a while, and...

- Regroup
  - Simplest service: 01_HelloWorld.{cpp|h}
    - Can we build this (rather than AssignmentCoordinatorTaskService)
      as task01?
      - Try to strip out all unneccessary code.
        - Need a minimal 00_ServiceList.h file.

- HelloWorld can now be run from the task01 executable. This is intended
  as a baseline minimal application, as HelloWorld uses a bare minimum of
  LMCP messages. This build has its own LCMP, such that we may (attempt to)
  prune LMCP to just the required messages.
  - HelloWorld seems to require only afrl::cmasi::KeyValuePair.
  - I made changes to LmcpGen to slightly improve diagnostics and to enable
    it to run without MDMS. These aren't pushed, as LmcpGen is in a separate
    repo to which I do not have committer access.

- I think the next step is to start with a copy of CMASI.xml as TASK01.xml
  (because this contains KeyValuePair) and iterate the task01 build
  (ninja -C build task01) to find and resolve link-time references to
  missing message classes.

- ^^^ Yes. Also need to copy and prune Services.

Feb 13th

- Finally: First successful disaggregated build of HelloWorld!

- Added tool `./show-src-files` to list source files (excluding Boost and 3rd-
  party) which have contributed code to a build executable (default:
  build/task01).
