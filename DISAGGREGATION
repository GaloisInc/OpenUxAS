- Rework one or more demos to run with disaggregated task01.
  - startup scripts
  - config files

- Are there tasks/services that require dependent instantiation?

- Some tasks listed in 00_ServiceList.h are also present as sentinels.
  If these need to be disaggregated, the sentinel aspect must be refactored.

- Plan a new directory layout and builder to support disaggregation of
  all targeted tasks and services.
